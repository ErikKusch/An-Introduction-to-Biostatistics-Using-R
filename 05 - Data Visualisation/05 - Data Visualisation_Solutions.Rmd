These are the solutions to the exercises contained within the handout to Data Visualisation which walks you through the basics of data visualisation in `R`using `ggplot2`. The plots presented here are using data from the `iris` data set supplied through the `datasets` package. 

Keep in mind that there is probably a myriad of other ways to reach the same conclusions as presented in these solutions.

# Packages
Recall the exercise that went along with the last seminar (Descriptive Statistics) where we learnt the difference between a basic and advanced preamble for package loading in `R`. Here (and in future exercises) I will only supply you with the advanced version of the preamble.  

Now let's load the `ggplot2` package into our `R` session so we'll be able to use its functionality for data visualisation as well as the `datasets` package to get the `iris` data set.

```{r Packages}
# function to load packages and install them if they haven't been installed yet
install.load.package <- function(x) {
  if (!require(x, character.only = TRUE))
    install.packages(x)
  require(x, character.only = TRUE)
}
# packages to load/install if necessary
package_vec <- c("ggplot2", "datasets")
# applying function install.load.package to all packages specified in package_vec
sapply(package_vec, install.load.package)
```

# Loading `R`-internal data sets (`iris`)  
The `iris` data set is included in the `datasets` package in `R`. An `R`-internal data set is loaded through the command `data()`. Take note that you do not have to assign this command's output to a new object (via `<-`). Instead, the dataset is loaded to your current environment by its name (iris, in this case). Keep in mind that this **can override** objects of the same name that are already present in your current session of `R`.
```{r RLoad}
data("iris")
```

# Inspect the data set    
Since we know that `iris` is a dataset, we can be reasonably sure that this object will be complex enough to warrant using the `str()` function for inspection:
```{r RInspect}
str(iris)
```

The `iris` dataset contains four measurements (`Sepal.Length`, `Sepal.Width`, `Petal.Length`, `Petal.Width`) for 150 flowers representing three species of iris (*Iris setosa*, *versicolor* and *virginica*).



# **Boxplot** of `Petal.Length` by `Species`    
```{r PlottingExercise1, tidy=FALSE}
ggplot(iris, # the data set
       aes(x=Species, y=Petal.Length) # aesthetics
       ) + geom_boxplot() + # this is the end of the bare minimum plot
  theme_bw() + labs(title="Petal Length of three different species of Iris")
```

THis boxplot shows us exactly how the distributions of petal length measurements of our three species of Iris are differing from one another. Despite the obvious trend in the data, **be sure not to report results through figures alone!** We will find out how to test whether the pattern we can observe here holds up to scrutiny at a later point in time of our seminars.



# **Scatterplot** of `Petal.Length` and `Petal.Width`    
```{r PlottingExercise2, tidy=FALSE}
ggplot(iris, # the data set
       aes(x=Petal.Width, y=Petal.Length) # aesthetics
       ) + geom_point() + # this is the end of the bare minimum plot
  theme_bw() + labs(title="Petal Width and Petal Length of three different species of Iris")
```


# **Scatterplot** of `Petal.Length` and `Petal.Width` grouped by `Species`    
```{r PlottingExercise3, tidy=FALSE}
ggplot(iris, # the data set
       aes(x=Petal.Width, y=Petal.Length, colour = Species) # aesthetics
       ) + geom_point() + # this is the end of the bare minimum plot
  theme_bw() + labs(title="Petal Width and Petal Length of three different species of Iris") + 
  theme(legend.justification=c(1,0), legend.position=c(1,0)) + # legend inside
  scale_color_discrete(name="Iris Species")  # Change legend title
```



# Relationship of `Sepal.Length` and `Sepal.Width`    
```{r PlottingExercise4, tidy=FALSE}
ggplot(iris, # the data set
       aes(x=Sepal.Width, y=Sepal.Length) # aesthetics
       ) + geom_point() + geom_smooth() + # this is the end of the bare minimum plot
  theme_bw() + labs(title="Petal Width and Petal Length of three different species of Iris")
```

# Relationship of `Sepal.Length` and `Sepal.Width` (grouped by `Species`)  
```{r PlottingExercise5, tidy=FALSE}
ggplot(iris, # the data set
       aes(x=Sepal.Width, y=Sepal.Length, colour = Species) # aesthetics
       ) + geom_point() + geom_smooth() + # this is the end of the bare minimum plot
  theme_bw() + labs(title="Petal Width and Petal Length of three different species of Iris") + 
  theme(legend.justification=c(1,0), legend.position=c(1,0)) + # legend inside
  scale_color_discrete(name="Iris Species")  # Change legend title
```
